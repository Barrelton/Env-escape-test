# THE ESCAPES/VULNS ARE ALL RATHER KNOWN AND PUBLIC VULNS

DO **NOT** ATTEMPT TO USE THESE VULNS FOR MALICIOUS PURPOSES
This test is made for people who are skeptical about the safety of Roblox executors or they want to test their own.
Code is unobfuscated and open sourced because of the reason above ^ (and if you think the script is malicious or smth)

**IF IT DOES NOT PRINT ANYTHING AFTER IT SAYS ITS RUNNING THEM AND NOTHING HAPPENS (for example notepad opening or the screenshot folder opening) YOUR EXECUTOR IS SAFE**

X = Failed the test (good)
⚠️ = Passed the test (BAD)
